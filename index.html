       Qatar is a small but wealthy country in the Middle East, located on a peninsula along the Persian Gulf. It is known for its vast natural gas and oil resources, which have helped make it one of the richest countries in the world. Qatar blends modern cities like Doha, with its tall skyscrapers and museums, with strong traditions in culture, religion, and family life.
