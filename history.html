    <h2>The rise of the Al Thani dynasty (mid-1800s)</h2>
    <p>The rise of the Al Thani dynasty in Qatar during the mid-1800s occurred as the Al Thani family gained local power during a time of regional conflict and weak outside control. After settling in Doha, Sheikh Mohammed bin Thani emerged as a respected leader who united local tribes and protected trade. Qatar faced pressure from powerful neighbors such as Bahrain and the Ottoman Empire, as well as growing British influence in the Gulf. In 1868, Britain officially recognized Mohammed bin Thani as the ruler of Qatar following conflicts with Bahrain, giving the Al Thani family political legitimacy. This recognition marked the beginning of Al Thani rule, which continues in Qatar today.</p>
    <h2> British treaties for protection (1916, 1934)</h2>
    <p>The British protection treaties placed Qatar under British protection in the early 1900s. Britain agreed to defend Qatar, while Qatar gave Britain control over its foreign relations. This helped secure Al Thani rule until Qatar became independent in 1971.</p>
    <h2>The 1972 bloodless coup</h2>
    <p>The 1972 bloodless coup in Qatar was a peaceful takeover in which Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani replaced his cousin while he was abroad. It strengthened the government and helped modernize Qatar.</p>
